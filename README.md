# Homegoing-Adventure-Game
Based on the novel Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, I created a text adventure game to mimic and interpret the events and themes in the novel using html pages and a bit of css. Disclaimer: there are many mature themes in this project and it spoils many chapters of the book. So, I highly recommend reading the book before you play the game. However, if you havn't read the book or you want a summary of a few of the chapters, try it out!
