			You decide that you shouldn't spit in the officer's face for fear of your life, but you are taken to jail and bailed out by your mother once again. "You can't do a single thing, can you?" Thats what keeps running through your head after a young boy says this to you during one of your marches. You decide to sit and talk to a janitor at a local barbershop bench about your problems and he pulls out a small glassine bag. Placing it in your hands he tells you, "When nothing helps, this do." After the janitor leaves, you swivel the bag through your hands for an hour and decide to quit your job. You have another choice.
