			You decide to quickly give each ex-girlfriend some money and leave immediately. You find a new job at the barbershop where you eventually become a manager. However, you never successfully become a proper father and you continue marching against segregation. While you maintain a decent relationship with your mother, she is still disappointed with your lack of parenting. One day in a march, there are particularly more police officers in the street. You think about the reverend who was shot when he was registering to vote and a pregnant woman who was shot while riding a newly desegregated bus and you begin to fear your fate in this particular march.
