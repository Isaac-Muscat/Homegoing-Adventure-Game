			You are an African-American man named Sonny reading in a jail and your mother, Willie, storms through the doors of the Harlem police station telling you to spend less time in jail and more time with your kids. You've had children within multiple relationships, and now you've become just as absent as your own father was. You also work on a housing team at the NAACP where you ask how the people in Harlem are faring. After you get bailed out of jail, you remember all the marches that you have participated in which results in your bail time. A couple marches later, you are arrested, however, one of the police officers punches you in the face. You begin to pucker you lips to spit as you look up at the threatening officer.
