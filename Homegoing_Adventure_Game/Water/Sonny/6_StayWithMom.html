			What Sonny wanted was to scream, to take the money, take what was left in his shoe and find somewhere to go shoot up until he could no longer remember the things his mother had told him. That was what he wanted to do. But he didn't do that. Instead, he stayed. He quit. He found a job. And he helped raise a marvellous child named Marcus with Josephine.
