			A few years pass. You wake up in your room to the sound of your mother. You understand you would need to score again to keep yourself from dying. When you hear your mother praying outside, you remember the times when you were mostly sober and you felt like you had more control over the dope. You wait for your mother to leave and then you make your way to your dealer with what little money you have to barely any dope. You meet Amani on your way back and you momentarily remember your past relationships. Amani tells you, "Your mama was here and she wants you to come home for Sunday dinner. You know, we could use some money." You tell her, "She ain't gon' give me nothing." But she insists stating, "She might if you clean yourself up."
