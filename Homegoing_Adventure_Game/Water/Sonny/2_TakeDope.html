			You wake up during the afternoon and you have an awful pain in your head. It's been one month since your first hit of dope and you can't stop. You've been out of work for the same amount of time and all your money has been spent on damn dope. Desperate for another hit, you wander outside and spot a lady who might have money. You also think about your mother. You reason you have three options. One of which is the responsible choice.
