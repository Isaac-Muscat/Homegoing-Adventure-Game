		<p>
			Clouded by your anger, you swipe some cash out of your mother's bag on the way out the door. You head over to your dealer and by another bag of dope and you immediately inject it. A week later, you realize you've just cut-off everyone who has cared for you and you enter a state of depression, using the dope as the antidote. Overwhelmed with guilt and shame, you commit suicide as you weren't useful to the world anyway. However, your mother, the janitor, your kids, and your ex-girlfriends are torn apart by your end. Your life would in fact have made the world a better place.
