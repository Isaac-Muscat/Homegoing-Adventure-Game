			Instead of facing your fear, you decide to hide from your ex-girlfriends out of shame. You visit your friend Mohammed who tells you, "Forget the NAACP. They ain't doing shit." He tries to get you to join the Nation of Islam, but you tell him, "Islam ain't getting shit done either." After conversing with your friend, you apply and are accepted a bartender job at the Jazzmine. After a month of working there, one of the jazz musicians, Amani captures your attention as she plays in the bar. Afterwards, you talk to her and she brings you over to her assumed apartment in the projects. You realize that she shares a room with multiple people who all seem to be lazily sedentary. You follow her into her room and she offers you some dope, telling you, "This is me. You still want it?"
