			Although you are resistant, you end up agreeing to visit your mother. As you make your way up to the door, you ensure that the glassine bag of dope is still harnessed in your shoe for emergencies sake. As your mom opens the door, you remember how she said, "I don't want to see you dead or worse." When you walk inside, you are hurt just by the way Willie and Josephine look at each other as Willie gives her some money to buy some food for her kids. As you sit down with your mother for dinner, you realize how hungry you are and you begin to eat everything in sight. As you eat, Willie begins to tell you about your father who you learn was a white man in Willie's eyes. As you decipher the meaning of the story she tells you, you begin to look towards the washroom to finish up the bag in your shoe. Abruptly, Willie pulls out a wad of cash and says, "This what you came for?" You see tears flowing from her eyes. Then your mother tells you, "Take it and go if you want."
