			You decide to tell the messenger man to send a message about Dove which would be brought to every village. When you tell Dove what you did she says, "Everything is equal." A few days later, your village is attacked and your father tells you and your mother to run into the woods. Maame starts to rock back and forth and Dove screams "My father is here!" Maame grabs you and gives you a black stone and tells you something about Baaba, fire, and your sister. Maame then tells you to run.
