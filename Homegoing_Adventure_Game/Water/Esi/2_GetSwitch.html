			Big Man takes the switch and he is about to hit Dove when Maame stops him and yells, "No!" Big Man is surprised and rhetorically asks, "No?" Maame stammers saying, “I—I just think that I should be the one to do it.” Big Man lowers his hand. “So be it,” he says. So, Maame hesitantly takes Dove to her hut and beats her with the switch. You hear cries coming from both of them. The next day, Big Man notices that Dove spills some water outside and so he beats Dove with the switch in front of other people in the village. After you witness this, you run over to Maame and you think about what to tell her.
