			A smiling white soldier grabs Esi and she is dragged to a corner of a castle where he rapes her. After he is finished, he looks disgusted and he drags her back to her spot. Esi is humiliated, confused, disoriented, hungry, and resentful of these people. One day, Esi and the other prisoners are herded out of the dungeon onto the beach. But for the rest of her life Esi would see a smile on a white face and remember the one the soldier gave her before taking her to the corner, how white men smiling just meant more evil was coming with the next wave.
