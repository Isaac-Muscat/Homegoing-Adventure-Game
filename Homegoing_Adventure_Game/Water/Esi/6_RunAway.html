			You decide to run to the woods and take the stone with you. However, you are eventually captured by men from the other village and tied up as you walk through the woods towards the Cape Coast Castle. You are brought to the basement of the Cape Coast Castle where people are pushed up against each other in their own feces. One day, you and all of the prisoners are rounded up in front of a few soldiers. One soldier grabs one woman and brings her over to the wall and you close your eyes. When you look up you see another soldier approaching you.
