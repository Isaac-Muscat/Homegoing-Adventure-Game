			You are too scared to leave your mother, so you stick with her. You hear all sorts of screams outside the hut, but you try calm down. Two warriors from the other village enter the hut and Maame grabs a knife and lunges at them. You curl up as this happens, but you hear a poignant scream and a feeble thump on the ground. You look down to see your mother is dead. You will never forgive yourself. The men approach you.
