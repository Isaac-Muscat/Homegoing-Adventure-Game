			For as long as you can remember, and perhaps even before, Maame had refused to choose her own house girl or house boy from among the prisoners who were paraded through the village each month, but because there were now so many prisoners, Big Man  started to insist upon a slave. Maame chose a girl and named her Abronoma, Little Dove. Dove was called useless and she was horrible at chores. "There’s only one way to train a slave,” says Big Man. He turns to you and says, “Esi, go and get me my switch.” The switch in question was made from two reeds tied together and it was used to beat people.
