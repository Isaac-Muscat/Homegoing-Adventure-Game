			You brace yourself and jump into the ocean, barely missing a rock on the way down. You swim to the surface, look up, and you see the confused faces of the soldiers, so you swim along the coast until you come across the nearest village. While wandering through the village you notice that you have lost the stone! You ask for some help and an old man notices your distress. He offers you a safe place to live, and you live the next few years growing up in the village. It seems the water has acted in your favour.
