			You decide to go over to Dove and give her some water. "Leave me," Dove says. You remain with Dove and she begins to talk about your mother who you discover was once a slave for the Fante family. You also discover that Dove's father is also a Big Man. You ask Dove what you can do to make things right and she asks you to send word to her father.
