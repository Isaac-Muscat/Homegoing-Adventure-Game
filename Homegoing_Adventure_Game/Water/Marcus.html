			Sonny has a child with Amani and they name him Marcus. Two decades later, Marcus is working on his thesis on racist systems for his Ph.D. in sociology. Sonny is terrified by water and his father tells him it's because black people "were brought over on slave ships." One day while he is wandering with his friends through an art museum, he spots a girl who seems oddly familiar. Although he is unable to talk to her, you eventually run into the girl a couple of weeks later at a dance party. Her name is Marjorie.
