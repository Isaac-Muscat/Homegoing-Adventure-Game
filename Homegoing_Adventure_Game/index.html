			Welcome to a timeless exploration of the novel Homegoing written by Yaa Gyasi. This text adventure game reflects my interpretation of the book. Your goal is to reach the end of both pathways (Water and Fire) to reach the final ending of the novel. Each link you choose will guide you through different stages of the book with various outcomes. So, choose wisely.

    	<figcaption>Both Esi and Effia posses black necklaces which are symbols for their connection to each other and their ancestry. Esi loses the stone while Effia is able to pass it to future generations, eventually ending up in the hands of marjorie. When Esi loses the stone, this symbolizes the loss of connection with her ancestry, culture, and familial connection which results from slavery. </figcaption>

    	<figcaption>Water is a symobol for slavery, the historical circumstances, and the brutality Esi's ancestors face as a result of the slave trade in America. For instance, Sonny is affected by the repercussions of slavery based on the transfer of slaves over the ocean from Africa to America by boat. Within the stories of Esi and Sonny, there are many obvious and subtle refrences to this symbol.</figcaption>

    	<img src="Images/fire.jpg">
    	<figcaption>Fire is a symobol for slavery, the historical circumstances, and the brutality Effia's ancestors face as a result of the slave trade and oppression in Africa. For example, Yaw is affected by the repercussions of colonialism in Ghana where he attempts to publish a book to encourage the fight for independance. The symbol of fire is immersed within Yaw's story as he is scarred by fire as he is metaphorically scarred by slvaery, oppression, and colonialism.</figcaption>
