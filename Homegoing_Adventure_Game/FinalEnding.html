			Marcus and Marjorie meet each other at a party, but they share an odd feeling of relatedness. They both converse and share their fears. Marjorie says she's afraid of fire. Marcus tells her he's afraid of water. Eventually, they agree to go to the Cape Coast Castle in Ghana, the shared origin ground of their ancestors. They both visit the castle with uneasy feelings and they eventually wander out of the castle onto the beach near the ocean with boats of no nationality, of every nationality. With the presence of fire pits and ocean water, both Marcus and Marjorie must face the symbolic historical circumstances which haunted their ancestors. They both dive into the ocean water and Marjorie takes off her stone necklace, giving it to Marcus. Marjorie places it onto Marcus's neck and says, "Welcome home."
