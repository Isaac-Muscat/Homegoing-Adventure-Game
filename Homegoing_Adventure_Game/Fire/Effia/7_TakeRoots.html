			Effia accepts the roots and takes Adwoa's advice. James finds the roots in his room and he is taken aback, calling it black magic. A month later, Effia realizes she is pregnant and James is thrilled. However, Cobbe becomes sick, so Effia returns to her village to pay her respects before his death. After his death, Baaba tells Effia, “You are nothing from nowhere. No mother and now no father.” She then looks at Effia’s stomach and smiles. “What can grow from nothing?”
