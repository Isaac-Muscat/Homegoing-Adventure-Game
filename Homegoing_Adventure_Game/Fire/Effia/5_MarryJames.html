			You agree to get married to James and Babba is relieved. She gives you a stone and tells you "it is a piece of your mother." After you and James are married, he takes you on tour of their home, the Cape Coast Castle. In the middle of the tour you hear screams from the basement, so you ask James, "What's below? Are their people down there?" James confirms that their are people in the basement. So, you yell at him saying, “You white people. My father warned me about your ways. Take me home. Take me home right now!” James replies saying, “Your home is no better.”
