			You meet Abeeku to express your love for him and he provides you with protection. Eventually, you are married to him, but you are unhappy with the aggressive nature in which he treats you. As a result, you constantly put on a persona of content to mask your emotions of despair. After a year, you bear a child, however, Abeeku's trade with the British becomes increasingly more important to the success and protection of the village. Other villages grow to despise Abeeku and war breaks out between the different villages while victims of the war are sold to the British as slaves. Abeeku's village is attacked and he is killed in the fight, leaving you to be a widow.
