			You tell Baaba, “I have gotten my blood.” Baaba places a hand over your lips and says, “You will not tell anyone. Do you understand? When anyone asks you if you have become a woman yet, you will answer no.” You then ask why and she lashes out yelling, “Who are you that you think you can question me, enh? If you do not do as I say, I will make sure you never speak again. Promise me you won't tell anyone.”
