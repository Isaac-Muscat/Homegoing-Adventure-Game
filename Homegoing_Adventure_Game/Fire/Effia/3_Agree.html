			You run to your mother and hug her. You tell her that your sorry and you won't tell anyone else about your womanhood. The next day, your brother, Fifi, tells you that “Abeeku has made an alliance with one of the most powerful Asante villages. We will help them sell their slaves to the British.” Then white men come into the village and Baaba makes you stay with other women while they meet with Abeeku. A week later, a white British man who lives in the Cape Coast Castle named James Collins asks for your hand in marriage. Cobbe, enraged, screams “She is all but promised to Abeeku!" Then Baaba responds saying, "Abeeku cannot marry her until her blood comes, and we have been waiting years now. I tell you, husband, I think she was cursed in that fire, a demon who will never become a woman.” A few days later, you and your parents meet with Abeeku and they convince him that Effia will not bear children, but she can help Abeeku's trade with the British prosper.
