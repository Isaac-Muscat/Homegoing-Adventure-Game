			As your parents grow old and continue beating you throughout your teenage years, everyone avoids you for fear of the curse of fire which halted your sexual development. You become isolated and depressed while you feel trapped. Why didn't you say anything? Why weren't you just a boy instead? Once your parents die, you run away from the village and die in the scorching fires of Fanteland.
