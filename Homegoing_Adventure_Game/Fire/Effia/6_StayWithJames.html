			You pull his hand from your mouth and stare at him for a while longer. You remembered your mother’s joy at seeing you leave, and knew that James was right. You couldn’t go home. As the weeks passed, you grow comfortable around James. You knew you were not supposed to care for James, and you keep hearing your father’s words echoing through your mind, how he had wanted more for you than to be the Fante wife of a white man.
