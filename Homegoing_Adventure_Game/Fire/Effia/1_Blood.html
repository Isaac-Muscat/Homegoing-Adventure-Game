			Your father nods and tells you, “The white men live in the Cape Coast Castle. There, they trade goods with our people. That man came from Cape Coast to marry Adwoa, and there will be more like him who will come and take our daughters away. But you, my own, I have bigger plans for you than to live as a white man’s wife. You will marry a man of our village.” In your mind, you think about marrying Abeeku and later that week, Abeeku eats dinner with your family. However, after dinner, Baaba tells you, "When your blood comes, Effia, you must hide it. You must tell me and no one else." A couple of weeks later, just two days after your fifteenth birthday, the blood comes.
