			You are a beutiful 14 year-old girl named Effia and nicknamed "Born of Fire". You live in a village in the musky heat of Fanteland, Ghana during the year 1775. While your father, Cobbe, beats your mother, Baaba, your mother beats you. And for every scar on your mother, there is a companion scar on yourself. A girl you admired, Adwoa Aidoo, becomes the first girl of the village to be proposed to by one of the British soldiers. You ask Baaba why Adwoa married this man and Baaba replies, "Because her mother says so." Your father, Cobbe, asks you, "Do you understand what just happened?"
