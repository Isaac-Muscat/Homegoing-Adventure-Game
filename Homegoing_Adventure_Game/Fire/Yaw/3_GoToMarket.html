			You decide to stop working on your book and go to the market with Esther. As you wonder through the market with her you notice people playing music and cooking food. For the first time in a long time, you don't feel so isolated. After five year, you realize you have fallen in love with her although it is very uncustomary to have an intimate relationship with your house maid. Now, the only two things left in your life that are unresolved is your relationship with Esther and your mother, Akua, who you are not sure is still alive.
