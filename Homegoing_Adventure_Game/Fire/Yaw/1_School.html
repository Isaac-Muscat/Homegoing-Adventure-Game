			The week ends and you're back at school teaching history for the tenth year. The school is well funded and the teenage students, with what little money they could get from their village, attend with fresh clothing. Although all of the students are well behaved, it is clear that they are off-put by the large scar on your face. Feeling the tension in the room as you teach, you have a choice.
