			You decide to ask if Esther would like to go visit your mother with you and she accepts. You both travel to Edweso and you ask around about your mother. You figure out that she is nicknamed "Crazy Woman" in the village and you walk up to her home with Esther. Akua hugs you and tells you how much she is sorry and how much she loves you. You sit down with her and she explains to you how you got the scar. How she had horrible dreams of fire. How she would sleepwalk at night. How she felt unbelievably guilty about what she had done. And for the first time in your life, you feel complete, united with your mother, and united with Esther. Eventually, you would raise a smart daughter with Esther named Marjorie.
