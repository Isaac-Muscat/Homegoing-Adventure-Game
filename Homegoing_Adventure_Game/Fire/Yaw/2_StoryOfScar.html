			Understanding the negative effects oof the tension in the classroom, you decide to tell the class about your scar. You ask them what they have heard about your scar, and they all talk about different stories that they have heard. After everyone finished, you ask them, "Whose story is correct?" One of the students raises their hand and says, "We cannot know which story is correct because we were not there." Although you resent your mother, you respond stating, "We believe the one who has the power. He is the one who gets to write the story. So when you study history, you must always ask yourself, Whose story am I missing?" After class, you think about the many letters your mother sent asking you to come see her. Edward also began inviting you over less and less. As a result, you decided to get a house girl named Esther. After a few weeks of Esther cooking you dinner and cleaning your house, she asks if you want to go with her to the market while you are in the middle of working on your book.
