			Feeling the tension in the room, you decide to try to ignore it. However, as the school days pass, the tension increase. It becomes an "elephant in the room" of sorts. After teaching for some time, you decide to place some focus on either your book or continue teaching as normal. You feel isolated from society because of your scar, but you finally come to your decision.
