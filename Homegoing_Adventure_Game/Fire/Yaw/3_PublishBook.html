			You focus on and finish your book and you are fairly proud of the result. You decide to publish the book, but after a few weeks, very few people end up reading it. Edward notices your isolation and he senses your negative emotions, so he talks to you about a smart female math teacher who teaches at the same school as you. Mrs. Boahen arranges for both of you to meet at a local market.
