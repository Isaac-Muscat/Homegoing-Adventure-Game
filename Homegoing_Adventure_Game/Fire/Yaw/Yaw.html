			You are a middle-aged single man named Yaw who teaches high school history at a Roman Catholic school in British colonized Ghana. When you were a young child, you were told that your mother, Akua, burned you in a fire and that's how you were left with an awful looking scar on the left side of your face. To this day, you resent your mother and blame her for being isolated from people who look at you with disgust. Currently, you are also working on a book about Ghanaian independence called Let the Africans Own Africa. Your best friend Edward and his wife let you eat at their house multiple days a week. They also tell you to save up money to go to England or America for more schooling because you can't lead a revolution from behind your teacher's desk. Today over dinner, Edward tells you, "What you need is a wife, Mr.Agyekum."
