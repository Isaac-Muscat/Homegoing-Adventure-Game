			You decide to yell at them and put them through detention. Although this temporarily works to reduce the level of insults, the tension within the classroom increases like fuel being added to a fire. The situation escalates to the point where you snap and you physically assault one of the children. Afterwards, you regret it, but you are fired from the school. You give up trying to finish your book, however, you take up a new job at a less funded school teaching history. This time, you make sure to avoid speaking about the scar.
